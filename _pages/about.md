I am a Research Fellow at the Kempner Institute at Harvard University. I received my B.A. in Neuroscience at Dartmouth College in 2015, with a focus on cellular and molecular neuroscience. I began my Neuroscience PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in 2017 where I pivoted my research focus to computational neuroscience and neuro-AI with my PhD advisor Konrad Kording. There, I was 1 of 45 students awarded the three-year Howard Hughes Medical Institute Gilliam Fellowship for Advanced Study in 2020. In 2020 and 2021 I was a TA for the Neuromatch Academy Computational Neuroscience and Deep Learning courses, and in 2023 I was a TA for the Imbizo Computational Neuroscience summer school in Cape Town, South Africa. I received my Ph.D. and began her position as a Kempner Research Fellow in 2023. 

I often spend my time learning latin dance or playing board games.

Research Focus

In the brain, is the most fundamental scale for learning and computation at multi-neuronal level, the single-neuron level, or at the level of a dendritic arbor? I investigate how the implementable details of single neurons impact our understanding of what the capabilities of single- and multi-neuronal systems should be. With a background in deep learning, cellular biophysics and dendritic computation, my research vision has three aspects:
1. How do the biological details of single neurons, such as dendritic branching, ion channel distributions, and synaptic clustering, impact how a neuron performs tasks? 
1. How can we use constraints from multi-neuronal system phenomena to identify normative tasks neurons should perform or objectives neurons should follow?
1. How do neuronal plasticity rules modify neuronal biological details so that neurons learn to perform normative tasks?
I also want to explore how neuronal details implemented in deep learning architectures impact learning, expressivity, and generalization.
